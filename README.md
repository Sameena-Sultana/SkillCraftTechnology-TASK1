TASK 1 : Data Distribution and Visualization Project

. TASK OVERVIEW:To analyze and visually represent the distribution of various environmental factors—both categorical and continuous variables in a dataset using python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly. The key aim is to understand patterns, trends, and relationships within the data through intuitive and informative visualizations.

.  DATASET USED : Hyderabad city's Environmental data

.  Fields in the Dataset:
   - Temperature(Continuous)       -	Recorded in °C; Helps analyze heat patterns and climate trends.
   - Rainfall(ContinuoUS)          - 	Measured in mm; Important for understanding precipitation trends.
   - Pollution_level	(Continuous)	- Could be in AQI or ppm; Reflects air quality over time.
   - Season	(Categorical)	        - e.g., Summer, Monsoon, Winter; Important for seasonal comparisons.
   - Month	(Categorical)	          - January to December; Helps in identifying monthly variations.
   - Region	(Categorical)         -	Sub-locations in Hyderabad; Allows for regional analysis.
   - Pollution_source(Categorical) -	e.g., Traffic, Industry, Domestic; Helps in source-wise pollution analysis.

 Main Purpose of the Task:
- To visualize the distribution of Continuous variables and Categorical variables with use of Use of  Histograms and Bar charts
- Trend Identification: Spot patterns over time (monthly or seasonal).
- Compare Categories: Analyze how pollution sources or seasons affect environment metrics.
- Policy Support: Provide visual evidence to support environmental policy or awareness campaigns.
- Public Engagement: Make data more digestible and engaging for the public.
